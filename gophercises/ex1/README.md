### Exercise 2: Url Shortener

    - Concept proposed by the platform ended up being too hard to achieve following its guidelines, thus it ended up using a different approach

Repository dedicated for this exercise: [https://github.com/Akirapearl/Go-url-shortener](https://github.com/Akirapearl/Go-url-shortener)

    ```
    Potential improvements:
        - TUI - Bubbletea
        - Allow customization : Define port manually upon first execution
        - Prepare Dockerfile
    ```
