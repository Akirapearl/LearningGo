Exercise 1: Factorial Calculation

Task: Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number.

    Create a function factorial that takes an integer n and returns the factorial of n using recursion.
    In the main function, prompt the user to enter a number.
    Call the factorial function with the input number and print the result.

Exercise 2: Palindrome Checker

Task: Write a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome.

    Create a function isPalindrome that takes a string and returns a boolean indicating if the string is a palindrome.
    In the main function, prompt the user to enter a string.
    Call the isPalindrome function with the input string and print whether it is a palindrome.

Exercise 3: Basic File I/O

Task: Write a program that reads a text file, counts the number of words in the file, and prints the result.

    Prompt the user to enter the filename.
    Open and read the file.
    Split the text into words and count them.
    Print the total number of words found.

Exercise 4: Sorting Algorithms

Task: Implement a simple sorting algorithm (e.g., Bubble Sort) to sort a list of integers.

    Create a function bubbleSort that takes a slice of integers and sorts it in ascending order.
    In the main function, define a slice of integers and print it.
    Call bubbleSort to sort the slice.
    Print the sorted slice.

Exercise 5: Unique Elements in a Slice

Task: Write a program that finds the unique elements in a slice of integers.

    Create a function uniqueElements that takes a slice of integers and returns a new slice with only the unique elements.
    In the main function, define a slice of integers with some duplicate values.
    Call the uniqueElements function and print the resulting slice of unique elements.
