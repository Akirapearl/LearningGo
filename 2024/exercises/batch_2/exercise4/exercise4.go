Exercise 4: Sorting Algorithms

Task: Implement a simple sorting algorithm (e.g., Bubble Sort) to sort a list of integers.

	Create a function bubbleSort that takes a slice of integers and sorts it in ascending order.
	In the main function, define a slice of integers and print it.
	Call bubbleSort to sort the slice.
	Print the sorted slice.
