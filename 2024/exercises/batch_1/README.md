###Exercise 1: Constants, Variables, and Basic Data Types

Task: Create a program that calculates the area and circumference of a circle.

    Define a constant for Pi (π = 3.14159).
    Declare a variable for the radius of the circle (e.g., radius).
    Calculate the area using the formula: Area = π * radius^2.
    Calculate the circumference using the formula: Circumference = 2 * π * radius.
    Print the results.

###Exercise 2: Functions and Control Structures

Task: Write a program that determines whether a given year is a leap year.

    Create a function isLeapYear that takes an integer year as an argument and returns a boolean.
    In the function, use control structures to determine if the year is a leap year:
        A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.
        However, if the year is divisible by 100, it is not a leap year unless it is also divisible by 400.
    In the main function, prompt the user to enter a year, call isLeapYear, and print whether the year is a leap year.

###Exercise 3: Arrays, Slices, Maps, and Loops

Task: Create a program that calculates the average of a list of numbers.

    Define an array or slice of integers with at least five elements.
    Use a loop to iterate through the elements and calculate the sum.
    Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements.
    Print the average.

###Exercise 4: Strings, Runes, and Bytes

Task: Write a program that counts the number of vowels in a given string.

    Prompt the user to enter a string.
    Convert the string to lowercase to handle case insensitivity.
    Iterate through the string, character by character (rune by rune).
    Count the vowels (a, e, i, o, u).
    Print the total number of vowels found.

###Exercise 5: Structs

Task: Create a program that stores and displays information about a book.

    Define a struct Book with the following fields: Title, Author, YearPublished, and ISBN.
    Create an instance of the Book struct and initialize it with values.
    Write a function printBookDetails that takes a Book struct as an argument and prints the book's details in a readable format.
    In the main function, call printBookDetails with the book instance.
